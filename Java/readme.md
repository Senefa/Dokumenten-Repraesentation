The folder Java contains three important subprojects:

	· StartFuseki: This folder contains the code which is necessary that the ontology will be uploaded on the Fuseki SPARQL server, so that queries can be executed on the ontology.

	· DR_GRP2: This folder contains a seperate Readme.md where the Java code is documented for the interfaces with the other system components

	· Demo without other components: This folder contains a version of the java code to show that the SPARQL queries work, without the interfaces to the other components. In case that the whole system cannot be shown in the Live Demo.
